statement vs expression

statement 
let temp = a+b;

expression
a+b

```

```

OR: Execute and find first truthy value (left to right) and once it found return it else, return last falsey value
AND: Execute and find first falsey value (left to right) and once it found return it else, return last truthy value
	***The precedence of (&&) is higher than (||), so it executes first.
