// Immediately Invoked Function Expression
// what is IIFE, when we want to run our specific function starting executing after complete it.. . that time we need
//like, talk out data base, we want after writing immediately basis that function should run so, our database get start working 

//interview ANS: Many times having with global scope polution like what is declare there, to prevent we use IIFE

// ERROR line 7, dont fix it, solution: need to add bracket and end last semicolon  or comment 


///////syntax is easy 
////// ()() in first bracket we will write our function and in second you know well we learn earlier in last lesson '03arrow.js'
